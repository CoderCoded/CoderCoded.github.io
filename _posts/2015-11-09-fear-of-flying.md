[Junction](http://hackjunction.com/) was one of the [Slush
hacks](www.slush.org/hacks/), held on November 6.-8. 2015 at Kattilahalli,
Suvilahti in Helsinki. This hackathon had nine tracks to choose from. When the
tracks were announced, we thought we might have a good idea for [.AERO
track](http://futureoftravel.co/) by Finnair, Reaktor and Finavia. After
signin up we didn't plan it any further, just kept in mind that it could be
something associated with fear of flying. Then we refined our idea during the hackathon.

### Why this topic?

30% of people are anxious about flying (at least in some point of their
lives). About 6% do not fly at all. _Fear of flying_ or _aviophobia_ is a
problem that is recognized, but currently only a handful of innovations exist
to cope with it. Some airlines provide hands-on courses a couple of times in a
year to cope with aviophobia. These courses cost money, but are highly
popular. We realized that there is practically zero content available for
aviophobic people during flights.

### How we planned to implement it?

New airplanes have a web server and a wi-fi access point for passengers. We
designed a set of apps that utilize an accelerometer attached to the web
server and the in-flight portal that provides the landing page for passengers
using the airplane wi-fi. We have produced 4 different apps to give you an
idea. Check out the [slideshow online](http://aero.codercoded.com).

#### Turbulence meter

Airplanes can take much more than what people experience during turbulence.
This meter displays the "safe zone" for airplane and plots the currently
experienced g-forces. Demo online
[here](http://aero.codercoded.com/turbulence/), *emulate accelerometer from
devtools, or view with mobile device.*

#### Mood meter

Passengers can now communicate their level of anxiety to the cabin crew by
using the passenger mood-meter. It is embarrassing to talk directly to flight
attendants about your fears when other people are listening. The mood-meter is
a very subtle way to inform cabin crew about the level of anxiety of the
passenger, and also the reason - another passenger makes you feel
uncomfortable, or you're afraid of current flight conditions. Check out the
[cabin crew view](http://aero.codercoded.com/seatmap/) or [passenger
app](http://aero.codercoded.com/slider/) demos online.

Cabin crew view shows a "seatmap heatmap" of passenger anxiety levels, making
it possible for cabin crew to react in situations during flight.

#### Airplane soundtrack

A lot of people think that the airplane makes sounds
that are not normal. This app plays the passenger all the normal sounds that
airplane makes during flights. This way they can reassure themselves that the
sounds they're hearing are perfectly normal

#### Fun in the turbulence

We think that turbulence should be _anticipated_ by the passengers. It is our
job to come up with ideas that get into life only during turbulence. There
could be games or similar that provide rewards during it, or something like we
envisioned with wobbly faces / things. Couple of demos:
[Kekkonen](http://aero.codercoded.com/fun/) and an
[NSFW](http://aero.codercoded.com/boobs/) version.

### What next?

The winning hacks have a chance to pitch the ideas at Slush, so we'll see you
there!
